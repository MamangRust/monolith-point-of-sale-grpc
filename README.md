# Point of sale Platform

The **Point of sale Platform** is a robust, scalable, and secure integrated system designed to provide a comprehensive online shopping experience. Built using a monolithic architecture, all core functionalities—such as user management, product catalog, shopping cart, order processing, and merchant interactions—are consolidated within a single application. This approach simplifies development,  and deployment, ensuring a consistent and efficient delivery of Point of sale services within a unified environment.
